# eC02
## About
We created a web project, [eC02.de](eC02.de), that allows for individuals to calculate their CO2 emissions based off of their use of transportation and compare it with others.

## Inspiration
We where inspired to create a system for personal accountability following the success of accounts like [Celebrity Jets](https://twitter.com/CelebJets). Rather than track the actions of others, we thought it would be interesting to see how our own actions impacted the world.

## What We Learned
This was an opportunity for our group to learn pure vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS in a short amount of time. It was especially interesting to learn CSS animations. We also learned how to use LAMP stack development in the Google Cloud environment.

## How We Built Our Project
We started with little knowledge of pure JavaScript or HTML, having only used completed frameworks or website builders previously. We started by researching our topic and vanilla implementations. Ethan and Tylor then began working on the main site functionalities, including the main HTML files, client side JavaScript, and CSS. Quinton acted as our Google operator, creating and managing our Google Cloud server and deployment and interfacing with Google Maps. Brian ran the research, creating the mathematical models, site content, and back end JavaScript.

## Challenges
The hardest challenge for us was bring artistic style and CSS formatting to our project. Learning animation systems and connecting it to our system was a time consuming process as we learned through failure. In the end, we are proud of the final style we produced.
